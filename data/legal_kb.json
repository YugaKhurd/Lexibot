Here, if A alters his course without any \nintention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of \navoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty \nof an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an which he \nknew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of \nfact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse \nhim in incurring the risk of running down C. \n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the \nconflagration from spreading.

Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, \nby or by consent of guardian.--Nothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound mind, \nby or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of that person, is an offence by reason of \n\n                \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n                     \n       \n                    \n                  \n                     \n                         \n      \n                           \n                \n                  \n                       \n      \n                          \n                   \n         \n                              \n                     \n               \n                  \n             \n          \n  \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n                   \n                 \n                                \n             \n     \n  \n    \n \n \n                    \n                    \n               116 any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or be \nknown by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided-\nProvisos. \nProvisos.-First.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nintentional causing of death, or to the attempting to cause \ndeath; \nSecondly.-That this exception shall not extend to the doing \nof anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause \ndeath, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or \ngrievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \nThirdly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nvoluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the attempting to cause \ngrievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death \nor grievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or \ninfirmity; \nFourthly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nabetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it \nwould not extend. \nIllustration \nA, in good faith, for his child's benefit without his child's \nconsent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to be \nlikely that the operation will cause the child's death, but not \nintending to cause the child's death. A is within the exception, in as \nmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \n90. \nConsent known to be given under fear or misconception. \n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.--A \nconsent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this \nCode, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, \nor has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of \nsuch fear or misconception; or \nConsent of insane person. \nConsent of insane person.-if the consent is given by a person \nwho, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to \nunderstand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his \n\n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n              \n              \n \n \n \n  \n          \n  \n                  \n             \n             \n               \n           \n \n                              \n \n                \n              \n              \n                  \n               \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n  \n                        \n                 \n                 \n             \n             \n               \n                 \n           \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                  \n               consent; or \nConsent of child. \nConsent of child.-unless the contrary appears from the context, if \nthe consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age. \n91. \nExclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause. \n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm \ncause.--The exceptions in sections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts \nwhich are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, or \nbe intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person \ngiving the consent, or on whose behalf the consent is given. \nIllustration \nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose \nof saving the life of the woman) is offence inexpediently of any harm \nwhich it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it \nis not an offence \"by reason of such harm\"; and the consent of the \nwoman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not \njustify the act. \n92. \nAct done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent. \n92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without \nconsent.-Nothing is an offence by reason of any harm which it may \ncauses to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even \nwithout that person's consent, if the circumstances are such that it \nis impossible for that person to signify consent, or if that person is \nincapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in \nlawful charge of him from whom it is possible to obtain consent in \ntime for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided-\nProvisos. \nProvisos.-First.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nintentional causing of death or the attempting to cause death; 117 \n\n \n                    \n                                       \n                               \n \n                          \n                   \n                \n \n                         \n                   \n        \n \n                             \n \n                   \n             \n             \n           \n                      \n                  \n                 \n      \n                   \n            \n             \n               \n       \n \n                        \n                  \n                   \n            \n                      \n   \n                  \n       \n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n                \n                 \n             \n \n                              \n \n                       Secondly.-That this exception shall not extend to the doing \nof anything which the person doing it knows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or \ngrievous hurt, or the curing of any grievous disease or \ninfirmity; \nThirdly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nvoluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to cause hurt, \nfor any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \nFourthly.-That this exception shall not extend to the \nabetment of any offence, to the committing of which offence it \nwould not extend. \nIllustrations \n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, \nfinds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z's death, but \nin good faith, for Z's benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers \nhis power of judging for himself. A has committed no offence. \n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it \nto be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \nand in good faith intending Z's benefit. A's ball gives Z a mortal \nwound. A has committed no offence. \n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely \nto prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. There is \nnot time to apply to the child's guardian. A performs the operation in \nspite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good faith, the \nchild's benefit. A has committed no offence. \n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People \nbelow hold out a blanket. A drops the child, from the house-top, \nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child's \nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has \ncommitted no offence. \nExplanation.-Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the \nmeaning of sections 88 89 and 92. \n93. \nCommunication made in good faith. \n93. Communication made in good faith.--No communication made in \ngood faith is an offence by reason of any harm to the person to whom \nit is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \nIllustration \nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his \n\n               \n              \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n                       \n           \n                  \n                   \n             \n                 \n             \n                 \n    \n                   \n                   \n               \n              \n      \n \n \n \n \n                  \n                \n              \n               \n    \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n                   \n                 \n                   \n           \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n 118 opinion that he cannot live.

Act to which a person is compelled by threats.--Except \nmurder, and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing \nis an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by \nthreats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonnably cause the \napprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence: Provided the person doing the act did not of his own \naccord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of \ninstant death, place himself in the situation by which he became \nsubject to such constraint. \nExplanation 1.-A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a \nthreat of being beaten, joins a gang of dacoits, knowing their \ncharacter, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the \nground of his having been compelled by his associates to do anything \nthat is an offence by law. \nExplantion 2.-A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, \nby threat of instant death, to do a thing which is an offence by law; \nfor example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door \nof a house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the \nbenefit of this exception. \n95. \nAct causing slight harm. \n95. Act causing slight harm.--Nothing is an offence by reason \nthat it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known \nto be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm. \nOf the Right of Private Defence \n96. \nThings done in private defence. \n\n                \n           \n \n \n \n  \n          \n \n \n                 \n             \n   \n \n                         \n            \n \n                    \n                                       \n                    \n          \n \n \n \n  \n              \n \n  \n                       \n               \n                  \n          \n              \n                   \n                  \n \n \n                             \n \n                    \n                  \n        \n \n                      \n             \n             \n               \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n          96.

Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C. \nExplanation 2.-Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the \ncommission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the \ncommission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission \nthereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. \n108. \nAbettor. \n108. Abettor.--A person abets an offence, who abets either the \ncommission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be \nan offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \nExplanation 1.-The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may \namount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \nExplanation 2.-To constitute the offence of abetment it is not \nnecessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect \nrequisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \nIllustrations \n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty \nof abetting B to commit murder. \n(b) A instigates B to murder D.

D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder. \nExplanation 3.-It is not necessary that the person abetted should \nbe capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to \ncommit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention \nas A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of \nabetting an offence. \n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child \nunder seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in \nconsequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and \nthereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by law of \ncommitting an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner \nas if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had \ncommitted murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of \ndeath. \n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in \nconsequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing \nthe nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary \nto law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B \nhas committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of \nsetting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment \nprovided for that offence. \n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B \nto take property belonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to \nbelieve that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, \nacting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and \ntherefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \nExplanation 4.-The abetment of an offence being an offence, the \nabetment of such an abetment is also an offence. \nIllustration \nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly \ninstigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of \nB's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the \npunishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A \nis also liable to the same punishment. \nExplanation 5.-It is not necessary to the commission of the \noffence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the 122 \n\n             \n           \n \n                              \n                        \n             \n                     \n             \n                    \n               \n               \n                   \n            \n     \n  \n \n \n \n       \n  \n               \n              \n              \n        \n                               \n                    \n         \n  \n \n  \n            \n          \n                     \n                      \n             \n            \n                \n       \n                        \n              \n             \n   \n \n                             \n \n                        \n                offence with the person who commits it.

It is agreed that A \nshall administer the poison. B then explains the plan to C mentioning \nthat a third person is to administer the poison, but without \nmentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and \ndelivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner \nexplained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in \nthe conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has \ntherefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable \nto the punishment for murder. \n108A. \nAbetment in India of offences outside India. \n1*[108A.

B sets fire to the house \nand at the same time commits theft of property there. A, though guilty \nof abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the \ntheft; for the theft was a distinct act, and not a probable \nconsequence of the burning. \n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at \nmidnight for the purpose of robbery, and provides them with arms for \nthat purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, \none of the inmates, murder Z.

Giving false evidence.--Whoever, being legally bound by an \noath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being \nbound by law to make a declaration upon any subject, makes any \nstatement which is false, and which he either knows or believes to be \nfalse or does not believe to be true, is said to give false evidence. \nExplanation 1.-A statement is within the meaning of this section \nwhether it is made verbally or otherwise. \nExplanation 2.-A false statement as to the belief of the person \nattesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing \nwhich he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing \nwhich he does not know. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one \nthousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the \njustice of B's claim. A has given false evidence. \n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he \nbelieves a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does \nnot believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he \nknows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence. \n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states \nthat he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in \ngood faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to \nhis belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the \nsignature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. \n\n \n                    \n                    \n              \n          \n                  \n            \n               \n             \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n            \n                \n                    \n           \n             \n            \n              \n                   \n                 \n             \n \n \n                             \n \n                    \n                 \n                \n \n                      \n                   \n   \n \n                        \n           \n                    \n                 \n               \n \n  \n \n  \n    \n \n \n             \n              (d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he \nknows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z \nwas at that place on the day named or not. \n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true \ninterpretation or translation of a statement or document, which he is \nbound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and \nwhich he does not believe to be a true interpretation or translation. \nA has given false evidence. \n192. \nFabricating false evidence. \n192. Fabricating false evidence.--Whoever causes any circumstance \nto exist or makes any false entry in any book or record, or makes any \ndocument containing a false statement, intending that such \ncircumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in \na judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public \nservant as such, or before an arbitrator, and that such circumstance, \nfalse entry or false statement, so appearing in evidence, may cause \nany person who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the \nevidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point \nmaterial to the result of such proceeding is said \"to fabricate false \nevidence\". \nIllustrations \n(a) A puts jewels into a box belonging to Z, with the intention \nthat they may be found in that box, and that this circumstance may \ncause Z to be convicted of theft. A has fabricated false evidence. \n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of \nusing it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice.

Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, \nintending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, \ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be \nguilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \nhomicide. \n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, \nkills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there.

But it may amount to culpable homicide \nto cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has \nbeen brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been \ncompletely born. \n300. \nMurder. \n300. Murder.--Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable \nhomicide is murder, if the act by which the death is caused is done \nwith the intention of causing death, or-\n2ndly.-If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily \ninjury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the \nperson to whom the harm is caused. or-\n3rdly.-If it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury \nto any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is \nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or-\n4thly.-If the person committing the act knows that it is so \nimminently dangerous that it must, in all probability, cause death, or \nsuch bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act \nwithout any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such \ninjury as aforesaid. \nIllustrations \n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in \nconsequence. A commits murder. \n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a \nblow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of \ncausing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty \nof murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound \n\n                \n               \n                \n               \n                \n      \n \n                \n                 \n               \n     \n \n                     \n               \n           \n \n                  \n              \n             \n               \n     \n \n              \n               \n              \n                  \n              \n      \n \n                  \n         \n \n              \n             \n \n \n                              \n \n                   \n            \n                 \n              \n   \n \n                         \n                 \n                  \n                    \n \n \n                        \n             \n                  \n       168 state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any \ndisease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of \nnature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he \nmay intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did \nnot intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary \ncourse of nature would cause death. \n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient \nto cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies \nin consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have \nintended to cause Z's death. \n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of \npersons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may \nnot have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \nException 1.-When culpable homicide is not murder.-Culpable \nhomicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power \nof self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of \nthe person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other \nperson by mistake or accident. \nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos: -\nFirst.-That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked \nby the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person. \nSecondly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in \nobedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of \nthe powers of such public servant. \nThirdly.-That the provocation is not given by anything done in \nthe lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \nExplanation.-Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough \nto prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation \ngiven by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, inasmuch \nas the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the \nchild was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused \nby the provocation. \n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this \nprovocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A \nkills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide. \n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to \nsudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \n\n \n                   \n                 \n                 \n   \n                     \n                \n             \n               \n        \n \n                 \n              \n                 \n             \n     \n \n                 \n               \n                  \n                   \n          \n          \n \n                              \n \n                        \n               \n              \n              \n    \n \n                  \n                  \n            \n               \n                  \n            \n \n                  \n              \n          \n        \n                  \n       \n \n                   \n             \n           \n \n \n                               \n (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate.

B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. \nA, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause \nhim to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z \nwith the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder. \nException 2.-Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in \nthe exercise in good faith of the right of private defence or person \nor property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the \ndeath of the person against whom he is exercising such right of \ndefence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more \nharm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \nIllustration \nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause \ngrievous hurt to A.

A unfastens the \nmoorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by \ndisposing substances in such a manner that the motion is produced \nwithout any other action on any person's part. A has therefore \nintentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's \nconsent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or \nknowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear \nor annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses and thereby \ncauses them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of motion \nto Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore \nused force to Z; and if A has done this without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or \nannoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the \npole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to \nZ, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used \nforce to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, without Z's \nconsent, in order to the commiss ion of an offence. A has used \ncriminal force to Z. \n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by \nhis own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it into \ncontact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if \nhe has done so without Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n\n \n                    \n                    \n             \n               \n               \n                  \n              \n            \n                 \n               \n                   \n         \n                      \n              \n              \n                 \n              \n               \n              \n   \n \n \n                    \n                      \n    \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n                  \n             \n                 \n             \n      \n \n                    \n             \n                 \n \n                              \n                     \n                 \n    \n \n                  \n               \n                 179 (e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that \nthe stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water, \nand dash up the water against Z's clothes or something carried by Z. \nHere, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A has used \nforce to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to \ninjure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman's veil. Here A intentionally \nuses force to her, and if he does so without her consent intending or \nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or \nannoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to \nbe boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power causes such \nmotion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, \nor with other water so situated that such contact must affect Z's \nsense of feeling, A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and \nif he has done this without Z's consent intending or knowing it to be \nlikely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has \nused criminal force. \n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent. Here, \nif A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \ncriminal force to Z. \n351. \nAssault. \n351. Assault.--Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation \nintending or knowing it to be likely that such gesture or preparation \nwill cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that \ngesture or preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \nExplanation.-Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the \nwords which a person uses may give to his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an assault. \nIllustrations \n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely \nthat he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike Z. A \nhas committed an assault. \n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending \nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that \nhe is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault \n\n  \n \n                    \n                      \n                \n          \n       \n \n \n \n  \n                \n \n                   \n             \n              \n           \n              \n       \n                \n              \n               \n  \n                   \n                    \n \n                       \n       \n \n                 \n       \n  \n \n  \n              \n  \n                       \n           \n                 \n               \n                \n                 \n              \n             \n       \n \n upon Z. \n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, \"I will give you a beating\". \nHere, though the words used by A could in no case amount to an \nassault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other \ncircumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture explained by the words may amount to an assault. \n352. \nPunishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave \nprovocation. \n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on \ngrave provocation.--Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for \na term which may extend to three months, or with fine which may extend \nto five hundred rupees, or with both. \nExplanation.-Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the \npunishment for an offence under this section, if the provocation is \nsought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for the \noffence, or \nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the \nlaw, or by a public servant, in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful \nexercise of the right of private defence. \nWhether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate \nthe offence, is a question of fact. \n353. \nAssault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of \nhis duty. \n353.

Subs, by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for \nlife \". \nExplanation 2.-A moving effected by the same act which effects \nthe severance may be a theft. \nExplanation 3.-A person is said to cause a thing to move by \nremoving an obstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating \nit from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \nExplanation 4.-A person, who by any means causes an animal to \nmove, is said to move that animal, and to move everything which, in \nconsequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \nExplanation 5.-The consent mentioned in the definition may be \nexpress or implied, and may be given either by the person in \npossession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either \nexpress or implied. \nIllustrations \n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of \ndishonestly taking the tree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. \nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's \ndog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A. \n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the \nbullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \n(d) A being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's \nplate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft. \n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of \na warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not \ntherefore be taken out of Z's possession, and A has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \n\n \n                     \n                \n     \n                    \n              \n    \n \n                      \n                \n                \n                  \n               \n                  \n \n \n                      \n                   \n                \n               \n                   \n            \n    \n \n \n                           \n              \n              \n              \n   \n \n                      \n             \n               \n      \n                        \n            \n                        \n      \n                     \n             \n             \n              \n                     \n  \n                       \n              \n               \n         \n                   \n                 188 (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z \noccupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft. \n(g) A finds a ring lying on the high-road, not in the possession \nof any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit \ncriminal misappropriation of property. \n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. \nNot venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of \nsearch and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly \nimprobable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of \ntaking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is \nforgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits \ntheft. \n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z \ncarries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, \nenters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and \ncarries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal \ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did \nwas not done dishonestly. \n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z \nretains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \nwatch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the \nproperty as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he \ntakes it dishonestly. \n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of \nZ's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed \non the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession \nwithout Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in \nZ's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied \nconsent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not \ncommitted theft. \n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and \nclothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable \nthat A may conceive that Z's wife is authorized to give away alms. If \nthis was A's impression, A has not committed theft. \n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, \nwhich A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as \n\n                      \n    \n \n                  \n               \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n                    \n            \n          \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n                \n              \n            \n            \n         \n  \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n                      \n             \n                                      \n            \n           \n  \n \n  \n             \n       \n \n \n                    \n             \n                   \n                   she has not authority from Z to give.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and Sch., for \"transportation for \nlife\". \n2. The words \"Trade or\" omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \nIllustrations \n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by \nZ. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the \nsum 1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery. \n(b) A without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document \npurporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the \nintention of selling the estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B \nthe purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to \nbearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A \nfraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand \nrupees. A commits forgery. \n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by \nA, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the \ncheque by inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the \npurpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque \nby inserting the sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B \nwithout B's authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with \na banker and intending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A \ndraws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to discount the \nbill, A is guilty of forgery. \n(f) Z's will contains these words-\"I direct that all my remaining \nproperty be equally divided between A, B and C.\" A dishonestly \nscratches out B's name, intending that it may be believed that the \n\n           \n \n                 \n                  \n              \n             \n       \n \n                   \n               \n                  \n                   \n          \n \n                       \n                 \n            \n     \n \n                       \n                    \n            \n              \n                \n   \n \n                    \n                  \n            \n              \n        \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n                             \n \n                   \n               \n     \n \n                   \n                  \n               \n                 \n               \n     \n                          \n                  \n              \n            \n                        \n                205 whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \n(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable \nto Z< for his order by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his \norder\" and signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \n\"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery. \n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to \ndefraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B \nbefore he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery. \n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a \ndifferent legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has \nprepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the \nwill. A has committed forgery. \n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's \nauthority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in \ndistressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by \nmeans of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as \nA made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property, A \nhas committed forgery. \n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's \nname certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain \nemployment under Z. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to \ndeceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter \ninto an express or implied contract for service. \nExplanation I.-A man's signature of his own name may amount to \nforgery. \nIllustrations \n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it \nmay be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery. \n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it \nwith Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bills as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing \nthe fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B \nis also guilty of forgery. \n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a \ndifferent person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own \nname, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the \nperson to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree \nagainst B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, \n\n                  \n                  \n               \n             \n      \n \n                  \n              \n             \n                \n              \n                 \n     \n \n                    \n               \n              \n                     \n     \n \n                              \n \n                           \n              \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n                \n            \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n  \n                    \n             \n              \n                       \n              \n             \n             \n          \n                \n  \n \n \n executes a lease of the estate to Z at a nominal rent and for a long \nperiod and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with \nintent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was \ngranted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own \nname, commits forgery by antedating it. \n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects \nwith B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and \nin order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note \nbinding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates \nthe note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the \nfirst head of the definition. \nExplanation 2.-The making of a false document in the name of a \nfictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was \nmade by real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it \nto be believed that the document was made by the person in his \nlifetime, may amount to forgery. \nIllustration \nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and \nfraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person \nwith intent to negotiate it.
